## Introduction

This document demonstrates my practice with Git branching: creating, merging, and deleting branches. The commands are shown in code chunks.

## Navigating to an already cloned repo
```{bash}
cd Downloads
cd Collaborate-1/
```

## Making a new branch
```{bash}
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch feature/practise
git checkout feature/practise
```

## Adding files to new branch
```{bash}
touch demofile.txt
echo "This is a text file" > demofile.txt
cat demofile.txt
```

## Pushing changes to github
```{bash}
git status
git add demofile.txt
git commit -m "added demo text file"
git push origin feature/practise
```

## Merging branch 
```{bash}
git checkout main
git merge feature/practise
ls
git push origin main
```

## Deleting branch
After deleting branch in github, the branch is deleted from device using:
```{bash}
git branch -d feature/practise
```
